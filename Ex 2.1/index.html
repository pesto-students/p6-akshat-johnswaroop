            <h1 class="title">What Is Ethereum?</h1>
            <p class="summary">At its core, Ethereum is a decentralized global software platform powered by blockchain
                technology. It is
                most commonly known for its native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH).

                Ethereum can be used by anyone to create any secured digital technology. It has a token designed to pay
                for work done supporting the blockchain, but participants can also use it to pay for tangible goods and
                services if accepted.

                Ethereum is designed to be scalable, programmable, secure, and decentralized. It is the blockchain of
                choice for developers and enterprises creating technology based upon it to change how many industries
                operate and how we go about our daily lives.</p>

            <h1 class="title">How Does Ethereum Work?</h1>
            <p class="summary">Vitalik Buterin, credited with conceiving Ethereum, published a white paper to introduce
                it in 2014.
                The Ethereum platform was launched in 2015 by Buterin and Joe Lubin, founder of the blockchain software
                company ConsenSys
                The founders of Ethereum were among the first to consider the full potential of blockchain technology
                beyond just enabling the secure virtual payment method.
                Since the launch of Ethereum, ether as a cryptocurrency has risen to become the second-largest
                cryptocurrency by market value. It is outranked only by Bitcoin.

            <h1 class="title">Proof-of-Stake Mechanism</h1>
            <p class="summary">Proof-of-stake differs from proof-of-work in that it doesn't require the energy-intensive
                computing
                referred to as mining to validate blocks. It uses a finalization protocol called Casper-FFG and the
                algorithm LMD Ghost, combined into a consensus mechanism called Gasper, which monitors consensus and
                defines how validators receive rewards for work or are punished for dishonesty.
                Solo validators must stake 32 ETH to activate their validation ability. Individuals can stake smaller
                amounts of ETH</p>

                Solo validators must stake 32 ETH to activate their validation ability. Individuals can stake smaller
                amounts of ETH, but they are required to join a validation pool and share any rewards. A validator
                creates a new block and attests that the information is valid in a process called attestation, where the
                block is broadcast to other validators called a committee who verify it and vote for its validity.
                Validators who act dishonestly are punished under proof-of-stake. Validators who attempt to attack the
                network are identified by Gasper, which identifies the blocks to accept and reject based on the votes of
                the validators.
                Dishonest validators are punished by having their staked ETH burned and being removed from the network.
                Burning refers to sending crypto to a wallet that has no keys, which takes them out of circulation.</p>
